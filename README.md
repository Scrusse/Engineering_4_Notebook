## LED_blinky.py

### Assignment Description

I wrote code that tells the Raspberry Pi to blink the LED that is built into it. When the code is running, the LED turns on for one second before turning off for one second and looping.

### Code

### Reflection

This was a pretty simple assignment. The only thing I had trouble with was getting the code to run. I would constantly get an error saying that it couldn't find import board but eventually I got it to work by literally just waiting.

## Launch Pad Part 1

### Assignment Description

I wrote code that displays a countdown from 10 to 0 ("liftoff") in the terminal using a for loop.

### Code

### Reflection

There wasn't much to do for this one once again. After trying to run the code without 3 different numbers in the for loop, I realized I needed to add a -1 so it would actually count down.

## Launch Pad Part 2

### Assignment Description

Adding on to the part 1 code, I connected 2 LEDs to my arduino using a breadboard. One of the LEDs was red and one was green. During the countdown, the red LED would blink every second until the message "LIFTOFF" was printed onto the terminal, at which point the red LED would stop blinking and the green LED would turn on for 10 seconds.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
